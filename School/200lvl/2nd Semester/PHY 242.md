## 🌈 1. Interference of Light

Light waves superpose → brightness varies → *interference fringes* appear.

### 🔹 Types of Fringes
- **Bright fringe:** path difference = `mλ`
- **Dark fringe:** path difference = `(m + ½)λ`

> [!formula] Key Relation
> Path difference:  
> `Δ = d sinθ`  
> Condition for constructive interference: `Δ = mλ`

> [!example] Quick Example
> If two slits are 0.2 mm apart and the wavelength is 600 nm, find the fringe spacing on a 1 m distant screen.  
>  
> `β = λD/d = (6×10⁻⁷ × 1)/(2×10⁻⁴) = 3×10⁻³ m = 3 mm`

## 🔹 2. Division of Wave Front

Light from *one source* is split into parts of the same wavefront.  
**Fresnel’s Biprism** creates two virtual sources → interference pattern.

> [!tip]
> The biprism acts like two small prisms base-to-base. Use it to measure wavelength of light.

> [!example]
> **Problem:**  
> Two virtual sources are 0.8 mm apart and the screen is 1 m away. If λ = 500 nm, find fringe width.  
> **Solution:**  
> $$
> [
> \beta = \frac{\lambda D}{d} = \frac{5×10^{-7}×1}{8×10^{-4}} = 6.25×10^{-4}\,\text{m} = 0.625\,\text{mm}

## 🔹 3. Rayleigh Refractometer

Used to measure *refractive index difference* of two liquids by comparing fringe shifts.

> [!formula]
> `n₂ - n₁ = (λΔN)/(t)`  
> where `ΔN` = fringe shift, `t` = thickness of liquid layer.

---

## 🔹 4. Division of Amplitude

Light splits into beams of *different intensities*.  
Used in thin films, Newton’s rings, interferometers.

---

## 🔹 5. Interference in Thin Films

Caused by reflection from upper and lower film surfaces.

> [!formula]
> Condition for bright fringe: `2n t cos r = (m + ½)λ` (for reflected light)

> [!example]
> Soap film shows colors because different wavelengths satisfy interference condition at different thicknesses.

> [!example]
> **Problem:**  
> Find the minimum film thickness that gives destructive interference for λ = 550 nm (normal incidence, air film, m = 0).  
> **Solution:**  
> $$
> [
> 2t = \frac{\lambda}{2} ⇒ t = \frac{λ}{4} = \frac{550}{4} = 137.5\,\text{nm}

## 🔹 6. Newton’s Rings

Circular fringes due to interference between light reflected from a plano-convex lens and a flat plate.

> [!formula]
> `D² = 4Rλm / n`  
> where `R` = radius of curvature, `m` = fringe order.

> [!example]
> Given `R = 1 m, λ = 600 nm, m = 5`,  
> `D = √(4×1×6×10⁻⁷×5) ≈ 2.45×10⁻³ m`

## 🔹 7. Michelson Interferometer

Splits light into two perpendicular paths using a beam splitter.  
Used to measure **wavelength**, **refractive index**, or **small displacements**.

> [!formula]
> `2d = mλ`  
> When mirror moves by distance `d`, number of fringes `m` passes.

---

## 🔹 8. Fabry–Perot Interferometer

Uses **multiple beam interference** between two parallel glass plates with partial reflection.

> [!tip]
> Produces sharp, circular fringes → high precision in measuring small wavelength differences.

> [!example]
> **Problem:**  
> If mirror moves 0.15 mm and 100 fringes pass a point, find wavelength.  
> **Solution:**  
> Path difference = 2×0.15 mm = 0.3 mm = 3×10⁻⁴ m  
> $$
> (λ = \frac{3×10^{-4}}{100} = 3×10^{-6}\,\text{m} = 3000\,\text{nm})
> $$

## 🔹 9. Interference Filters

Filters that pass only a *narrow wavelength band* using thin-film interference.

---

## 🔹 10. Diffraction

Bending of light around edges → produces intensity pattern.

---

## 🔹 11. Fraunhofer Diffraction (Single Slit)

Light source and screen are at infinity (practically, lenses are used).

> [!formula]
> Minima condition: `a sinθ = mλ`

> [!example]
> For slit width 0.1 mm and λ = 600 nm,  
> `θ₁ = λ/a = 6×10⁻⁷ / 1×10⁻⁴ = 0.006 rad ≈ 0.34°`

---

## 🔹 12. Diffraction by Circular Aperture

Gives **Airy disk pattern** (central bright circle + rings).  
Defines *resolving power* of optical instruments.

---

## 🔹 13. Zone Plate

Acts like a lens using diffraction zones → focuses light by constructive interference.

> [!tip]
> Focal length: `f = r₁² / λ`, where `r₁` = radius of first zone.

## 🔹 14. Cornu’s Spiral

Graphical tool to determine *intensity* in Fresnel diffraction.

## 🔹 15. Resolving Power of Optical Instruments

> [!formula]
> **Microscope:** `R = λ / (2μ sin α)`  
> **Telescope:** `R = 1.22 λ / D`

> [!tip]
> Smaller λ or larger aperture → better resolution.

> [!example]
> **Problem:**  
> For a telescope with D = 0.1 m and λ = 550 nm, find minimum resolvable angle.  
> **Solution:**  
> $$
> [

> ]

## 🔹 16. Polarization of Light

Light waves oscillate in many planes; *polarization* restricts vibration to one plane.

### Production Methods:
- Reflection
- Refraction
- Double refraction (calcite)

> [!example]
> Polaroid sunglasses reduce glare by absorbing horizontally polarized light.

---

## 🔹 17. Analysis of Polarized Light

Using **Nicol prism** or **Polaroid analyzer** to detect plane of polarization.

> [!formula]
> Malus’s Law: `I = I₀ cos²θ`

> [!formula]
> Malus’s Law: \( I = I_0 \cos^2\theta \)

> [!example]
> **Problem:**  
> Polarized light of intensity 20 W/m² passes through an analyzer at 30°. Find transmitted intensity.  
> **Solution:**  
> $$
> ( I = 20×\cos^2(30°) = 20×(0.75) = 15 W/m² )
> $$

## 🔹 18. Optical Activity

Certain substances (e.g. sugar) rotate the plane of polarization.

> [!formula]
> `α = [α] l c`  
> where `[α]` = specific rotation, `l` = path length, `c` = concentration.

---

## 🔹 19. Phase-Contrast Microscope

Converts **phase differences** in transparent specimens into **intensity differences** for visualization.

> [!tip]
> Used in biology to view unstained cells — converts invisible phase shifts to visible contrast.

> [!example]
> **Explanation:**  
> In a phase-contrast microscope, light passing through thicker parts of a cell lags in phase. A phase plate introduces an additional shift so interference creates visible contrast differences between regions of varying thickness.
