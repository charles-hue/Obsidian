My name is Okaro Chukwuebuka Charles and I am a third year student of Computer Science at University of Nigeria, Nsukka. I am currently maintaining a CGPA of approximately 3.0, with a strong improvement in my second year after overcoming the adjustment challenges of my first year.

My first year required significant adjustment to the university system, but i took that experience as a lesson rather than a setback. Since then, I have become more intentional about my academic performance, resulting in mostly B grades in my second year. This improvement reflects not only academic growth but also increased focus, determination, and commitment to progress.

Beyond schoolwork, I am deeply interested in strengthening my technical foundation within my field. I aim to build a strong academic base that will position me for advanced opportunities and meaningful contribution in the future
