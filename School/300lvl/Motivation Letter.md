My name is Okaro Chukwuebuka Charles, and I am a third year student of Computer Science at University of Nigeria, Nsukka. I am currently maintaining a CGPA of approximately 3.0, with a strong improvement in my second year after overcoming the adjustment challenges of my first year.

My first year required significant adjustment to the university system, but I took that experience as a lesson rather than a setback. Since then, I have become more intentional about my academic performance, resulting in mostly B grades in my second year. This improvement reflects not only academic growth but also increased focus, determination, and commitment to progress.

Beyond schoolwork, I am deeply interested in strengthening my technical foundation within my field. I aim to build a strong academic base that will position me for advanced opportunities and meaningful contribution in the future. My goal is not only to graduate successfully, but to develop the competence and discipline required to excel in whatever I take up.

This scholarship would provide critical support in allowing me to focus fully on my studies and sustain my academic improvement, serving as a recognition of my commitment to growth and improvement. I am determined to continue improving, expanding my knowledge, and making the most of the opportunities available to me. With your support, I am confident that I can build on my current progress and achieve even greater academic success.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
