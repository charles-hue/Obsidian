## Introduction

- A **program** is a set of instructions that tells a computer how to perform a specific task (e.g., Microsoft Word).  
- It can also be called an **application** or **software**.

### Structured Program
- A program that is easy to write, read, understand, debug, and maintain.  
- It is considered a good, elegant, and magnificent program.  
- It uses specific programming constructs to transfer control logically and orderly.  
- **Benefits**: Reduces complexity, shortens development time, and simplifies complex tasks.  
- **Structured programming** is the practice of using these constructs to ensure logical and orderly program flow.  

### Unstructured Program
- Does not use structured programming constructs.  
- The unconditional **goto statement** (e.g., in BASIC) is a key example of an unstructured construct.  
- It transfers control illogically, making programs difficult to write, read, understand, debug, and maintain.  
- **E.W. Dijkstra (1968)** famously stated that the *"Goto statement is considered harmful."*

**What is programming principles?**

- **Programming principles** are accepted, professional rules of conduct for writing programs.  
- **Programming** is the process of transforming instructions into code, including testing, debugging, and maintenance.  
- These principles help in writing high-quality code and maintaining good coding practices.

## Benefits of applying programming principles

- **Readability**: Makes code easy to read and understand for all team members.  
- **Extensibility**: Allows code to be easily extended without breaking existing rules.  
- **Maintainability**: Makes code easy to maintain due to a loosely coupled application structure.  
- **Modularity**: Allows a program to be divided into reusable pieces like functions, modules, and libraries.

## Types of programming principles

- Essential guidelines for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code.  

### Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)
- Emphasizes writing simple, straightforward code.  
- Avoids unnecessary complexity.  
- Example: A simple `addNumbers` function that returns the sum of two inputs.  

### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Advocates for reducing code duplication.  
- Use functions, loops, and algorithms for repetitive tasks.  
- Example: A `calculateCelsius` function used multiple times instead of rewriting the conversion logic.  

### Open/Closed Principle
- Code should be **open for extension** (adding new features) but **closed for modification** (avoiding changes to existing, working code).  

### Single Responsibility Principle
- Every class or module should have only **one reason to change** (i.e., one responsibility).  

### Separation of Concerns
- Dividing a program into distinct sections, each handling a separate concern.  
- Example: The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern separates data (Model), user interface (View), and logic (Controller).  

### You Aren't Going to Need It (YAGNI)
- Advises against adding functionality based on future "what if" scenarios.  
- Only implement what is necessary for the current requirements.  

### Document Your Code
- Use comments to explain the purpose and behavior of the code.  
- Makes it easier for others and your future self to understand the code.  

### Refactor
- The ongoing process of reviewing and optimizing code to improve efficiency and maintainability.  

### Clean Code at All Costs
- Prioritize code that is **easy to read and maintain** over "clever" but complex code.

## Structured Programming Constructs

- Classified into different classes/elements:  

### Selective control structures
- Transfer control selectively based on a condition.  
- Examples in Java: `if` statement, `switch-case` statement.  

### Repetitive control structures
- Transfer control repetitively to create loops.  
- Examples in Java: `while` loop, `for` loop, `do-while` loop.  

### Organisational control structures
- Used to organize a program into separate, addressable units.  
- These units perform a specific function.  
- Called a **procedure** in Pascal and a **method** in Java.  

### Repetitive and organisational control structure
- A hybrid class that is both organizational and repetitive.  
- The main example is **recursion**.  
- Recursion is a process where a function calls itself (directly or indirectly).  
- A **base case** (stopping condition) is essential to prevent infinite recursion.  
- Example: A factorial function where the result is defined as  

  $$n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \dots \times 1$$

## Assignments

1. Write a Java program to accept your name and age and print it.  
2. Write a structured Java program to read in a set of numbers *n* and calculate and print the sum at each iteration.  
3. Write a Java program that accepts a student's score and prints the grade based on a defined scale (e.g.,  
   $$0 \leq \text{score} \leq 39 \Rightarrow F$$  
   $$70 \leq \text{score} \leq 100 \Rightarrow A$$ )  
4. Write a Java program to calculate the factorial of any number *n*.

## Core Takeaways

- **Key Concept**: Structured vs. Unstructured Programming & Core Programming Principles.  

- **Summary**: Structured programming uses logical constructs (like loops and conditionals) to create programs that are easy to work with, unlike unstructured programs that rely on harmful `goto` statements. Following established principles like **KISS**, **DRY**, and **Single Responsibility** is key to writing high-quality, professional code.  

- **Exam Relevance**: You will likely be tested on the definitions of structured and unstructured programming, the purpose and examples of different programming principles, and the classification of control structures (selective, repetitive, organizational). You may also need to write code demonstrating these concepts.
